You will be working with the following information:
Conversation history: 
{chat_history} 

Latest message: 
{latest_message}

Your task is to:
1. Read the entire conversation history and the latest user query.  
2. Produce a single restated version of the latest user query that:  
   - Incorporates or clarifies relevant context from the conversation history, but only when needed. Avoid introducing additional topics or combining unrelated parts unless clearly intended by the user.
   - Stands on its own, so it can be understood without further context.  
   - Remains unchanged if the latest query has **no dependency** on prior context. Remain as a question if user sends a query.
3. Output only the reformulated_message in json format without adding any explanations, commentary, or system instructions.
