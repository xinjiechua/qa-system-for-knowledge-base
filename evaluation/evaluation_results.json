        "# HISTORY OF THE FACULTY\n\nThe provision of computer facilities and services at the Universiti Malaya (UM) began soon after the Computer Centre was officially formed in 1965. This made the university one of the pioneers in computer usage in Malaysia.\n\nIn December 1969, the Computer Centre took on an additional role of teaching and research of computer science and information technology. The Computer Centre Board was formed, comprising the Vice-Chancellor (as Chairman), the Director of Computer Centre (as Secretary), and a representative from each Faculty, Institute, Centre and the University Senate.\n\nIn 1974, the Diploma in Computer Science programme was introduced. From its inception in the 1974/1975 Session to the 1997/1998 Session, a total of 300 students had been awarded the Diploma. The Master of Computer Science (MCS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programme were two (2) higher degree programme by research approved by the Senate and had been administered by the Computer Centre since 1985.\n\nIn addition, the Computer Centre offered a four (4) years Bachelor of Computer Science programme. The first undergraduate enrolment for the 1990/1991 Session was 50 students.\n\nIn April 1st, 1993, the University Senate agreed to the formation of the Computer Centre Study Board. The Board proposed the establishment of a faculty to be called the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT). The existing Computer Centre was to be annulled and replaced by a Computer Services Division which was placed under the Chancellery.\n\nOn September 22nd, 1994, the University of Malaya Council agreed to the formation of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT), and the Computer Services Division. A sum of 4.2 million was obtained from the Ministry of Education under the Sixth Malaysian Plan to put up a new building for the faculty, with the necessary infrastructure for teaching, learning and research. The building was officially declared open by the Minister of Education, Dato' Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak on September 26th, 1996.",

        "# HISTORY OF THE FACULTY\n\nThe provision of computer facilities and services at the Universiti Malaya (UM) began soon after the Computer Centre was officially formed in 1965. This made the university one of the pioneers in computer usage in Malaysia.\n\nIn December 1969, the Computer Centre took on an additional role of teaching and research of computer science and information technology. The Computer Centre Board was formed, comprising the Vice-Chancellor (as Chairman), the Director of Computer Centre (as Secretary), and a representative from each Faculty, Institute, Centre and the University Senate.\n\nIn 1974, the Diploma in Computer Science programme was introduced. From its inception in the 1974/1975 Session to the 1997/1998 Session, a total of 300 students had been awarded the Diploma. The Master of Computer Science (MCS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programme were two (2) higher degree programme by research approved by the Senate and had been administered by the Computer Centre since 1985.\n\nIn addition, the Computer Centre offered a four (4) years Bachelor of Computer Science programme. The first undergraduate enrolment for the 1990/1991 Session was 50 students.\n\nIn April 1st, 1993, the University Senate agreed to the formation of the Computer Centre Study Board. The Board proposed the establishment of a faculty to be called the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT). The existing Computer Centre was to be annulled and replaced by a Computer Services Division which was placed under the Chancellery.\n\nOn September 22nd, 1994, the University of Malaya Council agreed to the formation of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT), and the Computer Services Division. A sum of 4.2 million was obtained from the Ministry of Education under the Sixth Malaysian Plan to put up a new building for the faculty, with the necessary infrastructure for teaching, learning and research. The building was officially declared open by the Minister of Education, Dato' Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak on September 26th, 1996.",

        "# Programme Synopsis\n\nThe Bachelor of Electrical Engineering exposes the students to the theory and applications of electricity, electronics, information and signal processing. During the four years (eight semesters) of study, this programme also offers a comprehensive view into the basic applications and principles in the field of electrical engineering. There is a variety of teaching-learning (delivery) modes of lectures, project work, design tasks, research, experiments, seminars, fieldwork and practical training, that encourages innovation and creativity among students. To strengthen and enhance students design skills and hands-on experience, integrated design and research project are introduced in the program. The curriculum structure requires a minimum of 137 credits to graduate, with an average of 5 or 6 courses in a semester. The programme also requires an industrial training attachment of 10 weeks. The objective of this attachment is to enable students to gain first-hand experience in the industry and to have an insight on how theories are put to practice in real situations. To expand students\u2019 experience beyond the classroom, the programme also requires the students to undergo several industrial visits and attend research and industrial talk given by the industries.\n\n# Outcome-Based Education (OBE)\n\nOutcome-Based Education (OBE) had been implemented in the Faculty of Engineering since 2004, in accordance with the directives of the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and the Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM). This is also one of the requirements for Malaysia to become a full member of the Washington Accord (WA), an international agreement to mutually recognize Bachelor degrees in the field of engineering.\n\nOBE is an internationally practised educational model that focuses on the measurement of student outcomes and the implementation of corrective measures to overcome deficiencies in course delivery methods/assessment/student attitude, etc. Curriculum is designed with specific course outcomes (COs) to prepare the graduates to achieve the graduate attributes/programme outcomes (POs) at the point of graduation. The POs are designed to produce graduates who are well-prepared to achieve the programme educational objectives (PEOs) 3 - 5 years after they have graduated. The PEOs and POs had been formulated in consultation with all major stakeholders (employers, alumni and students), to meet the demands of a challenging and globalized workplace.\n\n# UNIVERSITY VISION\n\n# UNIVERSITY MISSION\n\n# FACULTY VISION\n\n# FACULTY MISSION\n\n# Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs)\n\n# Programme Outcomes (POs)\n\n# Course Outcomes (COs)\n\n# DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING",

        "# BACHELOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING\n\n# Introduction\n\nBachelor of Engineering (Electrical) has been offered by the Faculty of Engineering since 1959. In 1974, Department of Electrical Engineering was established and since then, the Electrical Engineering Programme is managed by the department. This course has obtained its accreditation from Department of Public Service (Jabatan Perkhidmatan Awam) and Board of Engineers Malaysia (Lembaga Jurutera Malaysia). Due to the rapid evolving of telecommunications technology in the mid-1990s, the Bachelor of Engineering (Telecommunications) was established and parked under this department in 1996 and is persistently running until 2015. Since then, both programmes are merged and now known as the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering.\n\nIn meeting the Universiti Malaya\u2019s Mission and Vision, the Department of Electrical Engineering strives hard to provide quality education in preparing students for professional employment in the industry, commercial and academic sectors. The comprehensive curriculum content, with the innovative and state-of-the-art teaching and delivery techniques, is designed and planned to enrich the students\u2019 knowledge and experience which will effectively enhance their range of intellectual and practical skills. Since the past few years, around 30% of the students under this programme graduated with First Class and more than 80% of them found employment within 6 months after graduation. In 2024, this programme is ranked 56\u1d57\u02b0 by the QS World University Ranking in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering subject category. Apart from the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering, the Department also offers one Master\u2019s degree by coursework, Master\u2019s degree by research, and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). This provides an ample opportunity for students to pursue postgraduate studies.\n\nThe Department is also furnished with various high technology facilities designed for research and teaching. Among the facilities are the laboratories that come with reliable, up-to-date and advance equipment, computer laboratories and the Engineering Library. The main university computer facilities as well as common facilities provided by the Faculty such as workshop, high performance computer (HPC) and CAD/CAM systems, can be utilized by the students from the department as well. The department also receives support from the industries such as from Huawei, NXP, Motorola, Intel, DiGi, MEASAT, TNB, Telekom Malaysia, CREST, and many more. Furthermore, with the collaboration of Huawei, PESTECH, and NXP, three industrial laboratories has been established at the department. Together with the industrial partners, the professional bodies namely BEM, IEEE and IEM, have been providing input and suggestions to the department in enhancing the curriculum as well as the quality of the research (Final Year Project) and design (Integrated Design Project) projects that will be offered to the students throughout their studies.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING 24",

        "# Special Consideration\n\nA student may apply for \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d if he or she experiences a serious illness, traumatic event or misadventure that:\n\n- prevents him or her from undertaking assessments or completing assessment tasks by the due date; or\n- is likely to impair his or her performance in an assessment;\n- results in having to miss an assessment.\n\nIf \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d is granted, the student may be given an opportunity to overcome the disadvantage that he or she has experienced in the assessment or the assessment task.\n\nNote that \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d does not provide for a student\u2019s marks in an exam to be altered, regardless of the circumstances. It does not provide for a \u201cConceded Pass\u201d.\n\nAlso note that you must fulfil all assessment requirements to be allowed to progress from Stage 1 to Stage 2, likewise from Stage 2 to Stage 3.1 and beyond. Regardless of the gravity of the situation that arises, the UMMP cannot allow you to progress if you have not passed the summative assessments.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Q: Where online can I find and download a \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d form?\n\nA: You can download the form available on the Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya website at http://medicine.um.edu.my\n\n# Q: How long do I have to apply for \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d?\n\nA: You must apply for \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d within five (5) working days following the assessment, class etc. which you are seeking \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d for.\n\n# Q: What information do I have to include when applying for \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d?\n\nA: You must complete the form. You should have supporting documents from an appropriate professional authority, i.e., a registered medical practitioner or counsellor if you are unwell, OR submit a signed and witnessed Statutory Declaration or a police report form where you have experienced a misadventure.\n\nIf these sections are not completed properly, your \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d form will not be accepted.",
        "# Special Consideration and Leave of Absence\n\n# Q: Where do I submit my application for \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d?\n\nA: You should place your form with relevant documents in a sealed envelope marked \u201cConfidential\u201d and addressed to Deputy Dean (Undergraduate). You can either deliver the document to the Dean\u2019s office reception desk or email it to the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) at ddu@ummc.edu.my.\n\n# Q: Who approves my \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d request?\n\nA: For your \u201cSpecial Consideration\u201d request, the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) will consider your application for approval. You will be notified by email of the outcome.\n\n# Q: What do I do if I want to take a few days off for personal reasons other than illness or misadventure?\n\nA: Prior to your anticipated absence, you should download and fill in completely a \u201cShort Leave of Absence\u201d form available on the Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya website at http://medicine.um.edu.my. If your anticipated absence involves one or more Clinical School days, you must ask the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) to endorse the form. The Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) may refer you to the clinical discipline coordinator if your anticipated absence is considered to be inappropriate or causes you to miss a critical teaching session for which catch-up will be impossible. If your anticipated absence involves one or more PBL sessions, you must ask your PBL Coordinator to endorse the form. The PBL Coordinator may refer you to Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) if your anticipated absence is considered to be inappropriate. The Medical Education Research and Development Unit (MERDU) monitors students\u2019 absenteeism. If a student takes off excessively, he/she will be placed on a register of \u201cStudents at Risk of Failing\u201d. Depending on the reason for absence, the student will be counselled by the appropriate senior staff member. All students are reminded of the conduct expectations set out in the UMMP Statement of Expectations.\n\n# Q: Am I expected to be in the campus if I do not have any formal teaching sessions?\n\nA: Learning medicine requires full commitment and participation of students in all formal teaching sessions offered. In addition, free slots are made available on the timetable for students to undertake self-directed learning. Students are therefore expected to be available during all these sessions should additional time be required to include extra teaching activities, if required. Therefore, holidays are marked clearly on the calendar and these are the only protected vacation period allowable. Requests to make changes for classes during the academic year will NOT be entertained.\n\n# Q: How and where do I submit a short leave of absence application form?\n\nA: Because the completed form is (and will be kept) confidential, you should place it in a sealed envelope marked \u201cConfidential\u201d and addressed to Deputy Dean (Undergraduate). You can either deliver the form to the Dean\u2019s office reception desk or email it to the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) at ddu@ummc.edu.my.",
        "# Q: What do I need to do if I want to take short leave, suspend candidature or withdraw from my studies?\n\nA: You should obtain an application form for Suspension or Withdrawal of Candidature from the Dean\u2019s office, make an appointment with Deputy Dean (Undergraduate), and meet with him or her. Remember to take the form with you. The Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) will discuss your reasons for requesting to suspend or terminate your candidature and provide advice.\n\nIf the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) supports the request for suspension, and if after discussing it with the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) you decide to proceed with your application, the form needs to be forwarded to Dean for endorsement. Decisions regarding suspension of candidature rest with the Dean. For both suspension and termination of candidature, because the completed form is (and will be kept) confidential, you should place it in a sealed envelope marked \u201cConfidential\u201d and addressed to Deputy Dean (Undergraduate). You can either deliver the form to the Dean\u2019s office reception desk or email it to the Deputy Dean (Undergraduate) at ddu@ummc.edu.my.\n\n# Q: How do I know when to apply for Special Consideration versus applying for short leave of absence?\n\nA: You only apply for Special Consideration for reasons of illness or misadventure that are unforeseen. Short leave of absence is applied for prior to your absence when your absence is foreseen, e.g. you need to attend a conference, go to a funeral etc."

        "# Pre-internship Term (PRINT)\n\nThis is the last eight-week component in the UMMP for students towards the concluding part of the MIA 5001: Practice of Clinical Medicine 3 (Stage 3.3) course. It is designed to help prepare you for some of the practicalities of internship. You will undergo an orientation a week prior to PRINT on essential aspects of your transition into the medical workforce. The weeks are spent in clinical attachments. You are responsible for your own learning, but you are required to complete some performance assessment tasks in which you are assessed by your supervisor. The supervisor will commit at an agreed time to help you in your preparation for the assessment."

        "# ENCOUNTERING PATIENTS\n\nAs described above, from the first week of Stage 1, you spend one day each week in UMMC or CSU where you learn communication skills, systematic history taking and physical examination techniques. Early clinical contact is a feature of the UMMP.\n\n# STUDENT SUPPORT\n\nSupporting students to remain healthy and to keep their lives and studies in balance is important in UMMP. Systems of mentors, academic advisors and counsellors have been put in place. Whilst most new medical students are looking forward to studying medicine and eventually working as doctors, the start of the Medical Program can be a stressful time. Juggling study, family life, personal interests and confronting clinical experiences can, at times, be challenging. There may be significant financial and personal stresses for students.\n\nIn Stages 1 and 2, the first ports of call on personal or study-related problems are the mentors, academic advisors or counsellors. The best first approach for non-urgent matters is to send requesting an appointment with mentors, academic advisors or counsellors. If the matter is urgent, phone one of them directly instead. Contact details are available on the website.\n\nThere are also links to university policies and processes if you are struggling with academic progress. This website is continually updated."

        "knowledge of the basic medical sciences in the diagnosis, assessment, management and prevention of health problems.\n\n# The Pt-Dr Theme\n\ncovers the clinical aspects of health and disease, both theoretically and from a practice perspective. It encompasses the diagnosis and assessment of patients through history taking, physical examination and the use of other investigations; communication skills; the management of clinical problems; basic procedural skills; and the identification and application of research-based evidence in health care practice (evidence-based medicine, abbreviated EBM).\n\n# The Pop-Med Theme\n\nis designed to give you a population perspective on health and disease. It examines the determinants of health and disease in populations (especially the Malaysian population) such as the distribution of diseases, their risk factors in communities and the implications; screening; prevention of disease and the promotion of health; variations in access to health care among different communities; the organisation of the Malaysian healthcare system; and the processes by which evidence-based, ethical and economically responsible decisions are made about the use of health-care resources.\n\n# The PPD Theme\n\ncovers the areas of professionalism, health law and ethics and self-care in medical practice; ensures that you acquire the skills necessary to be a reflective practitioner. The content of the PPD Theme is specifically designed to comply with the Code of Professional Conduct by the Malaysian Medical Council - as a statement of the principles of conduct for doctors.\n\n# Course - MIA 1001: Medical Sciences 1 (Stage 1) and Course - MIA 2001: Medical Sciences 2 (Stage 2)\n\ncomprise of 11 blocks.

The Postings consist of attachments to ward services and associated clinics in UMMC and other identified clinical services. More than two-thirds of your week is spent in the clinical activities of the disciplines to which you are attached. A progressive increase in clinical attendance and responsibility is expected during these attachments. The topics covered are drawn from all four curriculum Themes. Time is allowed for self-directed learning. A clinical supervisor is appointed for each group in each attachment during all your postings. The supervisor, usually a senior clinician, has responsibility for overseeing your training during the attachment and Postings. During this time, you will be required to complete a series of tasks, which your supervisor will assess. This assessment will contribute to the assessment of your progressive mastery of the knowledge and clinical skills that you must assimilate. Population Medicine and PPD Theme tasks are continuous throughout Stage 3.\n\nMost of your learning in Stage 3 is achieved through practical clinical experience gained during attachments to clinical teams or placements in the community. These are sometimes called \u2018clinical clerkships\u2019. They are supplemented by structured teaching in the form of lectures, tutorials and specified learning exercises in which your performance is assessed by your clinical supervisor. The balance between clerkship-based activities and scheduled sessions varies across different attachments and different settings.\n\n# Elective Term\n\nThe objective of the Elective Term is to provide students who have successfully completed the MIA 3001: Practice of Clinical Medicine (Stage 3.1) course an opportunity to gain further exposure in clinical, community or research areas in another institution in Malaysia or overseas. You may choose an elective placement that is organised by Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya or you may determine your own placement. At the end of the Elective Term you are required to submit a written report. In an event if you are required to repeat a posting during the Elective period in Stage 3.1, you may be given an opportunity to undertake Elective posting at the end of Stage 3.2.",

Focusing on the human side of the medical profession, the thematic syllabus adopted here integrates the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Authentic, medical related audio and print materials are used and students practise producing various types of oral and written texts common in the medical discipline. They will also carry out site visits to observe medical and allied health professionals involved in real-time interactions in clinical settings. Peer review of the individual student\u2019s performance in assigned tasks and keeping of reflective journals will be encouraged to promote a culture of independent learning that is essential for medical students. Accuracy and sociocultural appropriacy of language forms and vocabulary are targeted across all activities.

While you do that, I encourage you to go forth in a spirit of exploration and try new things - choose courses that expose you to new ideas and alternative ways of thinking.

A combination of program courses, SHE courses, Elite programmes and mobility programmes nurtures your knowledge, experience, and creativity. So, embrace the blended learning of the 21st century. Experiment!\n\nFCA\u2019s talented and versatile faculty will be your guides and allies in your exploration. They are your greatest resource. They are leaders in their fields and are applying their expertise through scholarship, research, and practice.

As faculty, we are hired to ask questions and to explore possible answers\u2014in collaboration with our colleagues here and at other universities, with our graduate students, and with our undergraduates. The products of our research are publications, performances, and exhibitions. As part of your participation in this culture of inquiry, work with your supervisors to plan how you are going to undertake your own work of research or creative activity \u2014don\u2019t be afraid to explore ways of generating new ideas and new knowledge, which is the fundamental work of a research university.\n\nFinally, I would encourage you to take advantage of UM\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s premier international institutions. UM offers an immense array of opportunities to create a truly global education, by, first, getting to know your fellow students. To our international students: reach out, as difficult as this is when you are in a strange place, away from the comfort of home. Ask questions about how things work here; don\u2019t be afraid to show you don\u2019t know; make the effort to make real friends with students from various countries.\n\nI want you to know that the entire faculty community is here to support, sustain, and encourage you as you commit to study here. We could not be more privileged to welcome you into this vibrant learning community. It is you who make us what we are, and we look forward to the fresh ideas and energy you bring to our faculty.
