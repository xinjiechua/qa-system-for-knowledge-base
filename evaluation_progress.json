This made the university one of the pioneers in computer usage in Malaysia.\n\nIn December 1969, the Computer Centre took on an additional role of teaching and research of computer science and information technology. The Computer Centre Board was formed, comprising the Vice-Chancellor (as Chairman), the Director of Computer Centre (as Secretary), and a representative from each Faculty, Institute, Centre and the University Senate.\n\nIn 1974, the Diploma in Computer Science programme was introduced. From its inception in the 1974/1975 Session to the 1997/1998 Session, a total of 300 students had been awarded the Diploma. The Master of Computer Science (MCS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programme were two (2) higher degree programme by research approved by the Senate and had been administered by the Computer Centre since 1985.\n\nIn addition, the Computer Centre offered a four (4) years Bachelor of Computer Science programme. The first undergraduate enrolment for the 1990/1991 Session was 50 students.\n\nIn April 1st, 1993, the University Senate agreed to the formation of the Computer Centre Study Board. The Board proposed the establishment of a faculty to be called the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT). The existing Computer Centre was to be annulled and replaced by a Computer Services Division which was placed under the Chancellery.\n\nOn September 22nd, 1994, the University of Malaya Council agreed to the formation of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT), and the Computer Services Division. A sum of 4.2 million was obtained from the Ministry of Education under the Sixth Malaysian Plan to put up a new building for the faculty, with the necessary infrastructure for teaching, learning and research. The building was officially declared open by the Minister of Education, Dato' Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak on September 26th, 1996.", "# Programme Offered\n\nThere are six (6) programmes offered under the Computer Science as follows:\n\n1.

Systems of mentors, academic advisors and counsellors have been put in place. Whilst most new medical students are looking forward to studying medicine and eventually working as doctors, the start of the Medical Program can be a stressful time. Juggling study, family life, personal interests and confronting clinical experiences can, at times, be challenging. There may be significant financial and personal stresses for students.\n\nIn Stages 1 and 2, the first ports of call on personal or study-related problems are the mentors, academic advisors or counsellors. The best first approach for non-urgent matters is to send requesting an appointment with mentors, academic advisors or counsellors. If the matter is urgent, phone one of them directly instead.

It examines the determinants of health and disease in populations (especially the Malaysian population) such as the distribution of diseases, their risk factors in communities and the implications; screening; prevention of disease and the promotion of health; variations in access to health care among different communities; the organisation of the Malaysian healthcare system; and the processes by which evidence-based, ethical and economically responsible decisions are made about the use of health-care resources.\n\n# The PPD Theme\n\ncovers the areas of professionalism, health law and ethics and self-care in medical practice; ensures that you acquire the skills necessary to be a reflective practitioner.

The Postings consist of attachments to ward services and associated clinics in UMMC and other identified clinical services. More than two-thirds of your week is spent in the clinical activities of the disciplines to which you are attached. A progressive increase in clinical attendance and responsibility is expected during these attachments. The topics covered are drawn from all four curriculum Themes. Time is allowed for self-directed learning. A clinical supervisor is appointed for each group in each attachment during all your postings. The supervisor, usually a senior clinician, has responsibility for overseeing your training during the attachment and Postings. During this time, you will be required to complete a series of tasks, which your supervisor will assess. This assessment will contribute to the assessment of your progressive mastery of the knowledge and clinical skills that you must assimilate. Population Medicine and PPD Theme tasks are continuous throughout Stage 3.\n\nMost of your learning in Stage 3 is achieved through practical clinical experience gained during attachments to clinical teams or placements in the community. These are sometimes called \u2018clinical clerkships\u2019. They are supplemented by structured teaching in the form of lectures, tutorials and specified learning exercises in which your performance is assessed by your clinical supervisor.

They will also carry out site visits to observe medical and allied health professionals involved in real-time interactions in clinical settings. Peer review of the individual student\u2019s performance in assigned tasks and keeping of reflective journals will be encouraged to promote a culture of independent learning that is essential for medical students.

The PLOs are devised to enhance your hard skills and soft skills, equipping you with essential capacities to thrive in the increasingly changing and complex world and to thrive not only in your artistic/professional life but also in the community at large.\n\nUnder the guidance of your academic advisor, you will discuss your interests and aspirations, as well as the courses you will take for three years. While you do that, I encourage you to go forth in a spirit of exploration and try new things - choose courses that expose you to new ideas and alternative ways of thinking. SHE courses challenge you to think out of the box and help to broaden your knowledge beyond your field of specialization. A combination of program courses, SHE courses, Elite programmes and mobility programmes nurtures your knowledge, experience, and creativity. So, embrace the blended learning of the 21st century. Experiment!\n\nFCA\u2019s talented and versatile faculty will be your guides and allies in your exploration. They are your greatest resource. They are leaders in their fields and are applying their expertise through scholarship, research, and practice. Get to know them \u2013 talk to them after class, seek them out at campus events and during office hours, ask them about their research and tell them about your own ideas. They will challenge you, guide you, and open doors to new trajectories.\n\nWhat does it mean to study at a research university? The heart of UM as a major research university is a culture of inquiry. As faculty, we are hired to ask questions and to explore possible answers\u2014in collaboration with our colleagues here and at other universities, with our graduate students, and with our undergraduates. The products of our research are publications, performances, and exhibitions. As part of your participation in this culture of inquiry, work with your supervisors to plan how you are going to undertake your own work of research or creative activity \u2014don\u2019t be afraid to explore ways of generating new ideas and new knowledge, which is the fundamental work of a research university.\n\nFinally, I would encourage you to take advantage of UM\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s premier international institutions. UM offers an immense array of opportunities to create a truly global education, by, first, getting to know your fellow students. To our international students: reach out, as difficult as this is when you are in a strange place, away from the comfort of home. Ask questions about how things work here; don\u2019t be afraid to show you don\u2019t know; make the effort to make real friends with students from various countries.\n\nI want you to know that the entire faculty community is here to support, sustain, and encourage you as you commit to study here. We could not be more privileged to welcome you into this vibrant learning community. It is you who make us what we are, and we look forward to the fresh ideas and energy you bring to our faculty.

Di akhir program ini pelajar harus memilih di antara dua pengkhususan iaitu Projek Seni Persembahan atau Penulisan Akhir Ilmiah untuk dinilai bagi melengkapkan pengajian. Melalui Projek Seni Persembahan akhir, pelajar berpeluang memilih pengkhususan untuk dinilai iaitu dalam aspek lakonan, pengarahan, sinografi dan pengurusan produksi. Setelah menamatkan pengajian, graduan boleh memilih untuk melanjutkan pelajaran dalam bidang drama atau bidang yang berkaitan, atau boleh memulakan kerjaya profesional dalam industri seni persembahan atau dalam bidang pendidikan.\n\nThe Drama Department program focuses on the art of drama and theater that gives students a comprehensive understanding of theory, history, drama practice and develops their skills in the field of performing arts. Students are usually involved in a variety of practical courses and experiences including classes such as acting techniques, vocal and movement techniques, script analysis, theater history, dramatic literature, directing, stage design, and theater production. At the end of the program students must choose between two specialties, the Performing Arts Project or the Academic Writing dissertation to be evaluated for completing their studies. Through the final Performing Arts Project, students have an opportunity to choose specialization for evaluation in the areas of acting, directing, cinematography and production management.
