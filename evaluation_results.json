It is designed to help prepare you for some of the practicalities of internship. You will undergo an orientation a week prior to PRINT on essential aspects of your transition into the medical workforce. The weeks are spent in clinical attachments.

The supervisor will commit at an agreed time to help you in your preparation for the assessment.",

The balance between clerkship-based activities and scheduled sessions varies across different attachments and different settings.\n\nAn Elective Term is placed prior to the beginning of Stage 3.2 and the Pre-Internship Term (PRINT) is at the end of Stage 3.3."

Two academic programmes were offered initially, a degree in Bachelor of Performing Arts (with Honours) with a major in either Drama or Music. By the year 2000, the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education approved our postgraduate programmes. We were then able to offer courses leading to a Master\u2019s degree in two areas of specialisation, the performing arts and visual arts.\n\nShortly after, the Public Service Department began recognising our Bachelor degree qualifications for the purpose of appointment to public service. In 2002, we began offering Doctoral Degrees in these fields of study. The MA in Visual Arts program began its first teaching semester in 2003, initiated by renowned artist, curator and art historian, the late Redza Piyadasa. Finally, we began offering a Bachelor Degree of Performing Arts with a dance major in 2005."
